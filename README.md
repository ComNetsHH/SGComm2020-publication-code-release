The paper "Evaluation of LTE based Communication for Fast State Estimation in Low Voltage Grids" is published at the IEEE SmartGridComm 2020 conference which is held virtually.

In it, the capability of LTE to support a fast state estimation branch current algorithm is analyzed analytically and via simulations.

In the `Matlab` directory you can find the evaluation scripts used in this work.

In the `ns-3-dev-repo` you can find a patch for the ns-3-dev branch used in this work as well as the simulation results used for plots in the paper.
Please use the version [3.31](https://www.nsnam.org/releases/ns-3-31/) of ns-3 together with the provided patch to recreate the simulation.
